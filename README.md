To correctly set up the `schema` submodule, run `git submodule init`, and then `git submodule update`.

Run `src/setup_environment.py` when you clone the repository. This will install a [virtual python environment](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-virtual-environment) in the main project directory. It will then install the external dependencies into this environment from PyPI using 
`pip`. (This will NOT install any non-python dependencies such as MongoDB, and Android Debug Bridge as the process for that depends on your 
distribution. You will have to do that manually).
  - Note: Debian-based systems do not install `venv` or `pip` with python by default - use `sudo apt install` to install `python3.8`, `python3-venv` and `python3-pip`.

There is also a directory called `data/` that needs specific files like `competition.txt` and a directory called `api_keys/` which contains `tba_key.txt` and `cloud_password.txt`.
The `competition.txt` file is created by `src/setup_competition.py` and the two keys need to be added manually.

When testing from the command line, remember to `activate` the virtual environment (`source .venv/bin/activate` on
bash/zsh). Instructions for other shells, along with more in-depth information about Python virtual environments, can be
found [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html).

To run the server in production mode on linux or MacOS make sure to run `export SCOUTING_SERVER_ENV=production`, to take the server out of production mode run, `unset SCOUTING_SERVER_ENV`
